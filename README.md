# google-homepage
This is a copy of Google's homepage that I created utilizing HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project.
I utilized several new HTML/CSS techniques in this project including the following:
-- Making horizontal nav-bars
-- Positioning divs on the page
-- Placing images in text input boxes
-- Resizing images
-- Adjusting fonts
