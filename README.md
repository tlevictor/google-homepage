# google-homepage
This is a copy of Google's homepage that I created utilizing HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project.
I utilized several new HTML/CSS techniques in this project including the following:<br>
-- Making horizontal nav-bars<br>
-- Positioning divs on the page<br>
-- Placing images in text input boxes <br>
-- Resizing images<br>
-- Adjusting fonts
